## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
?mtcars
```
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
median(mtcars$mpg)
```
Yes the average milage is greater than median milage which mean The distribution is skewed to the right
```{r}
iqr_mt <- IQR(mtcars$wt)
iqr_mt
sd(mtcars$wt)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=wt)) + geom_point(alpha=0.8) +ggtitle("Displacement vs Weight")
```
Cars with higher displacement have higher weight

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point(alpha=0.8) +ggtitle(" Weight Vs Mileage")
```
Heavy the cars had lower the mileage

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=hp)) + geom_point(alpha=0.8) +ggtitle("Milage vs Horsepower")
```
cars with higher horsepower have lower milage i.e. heavy cars tenf to have lower milage

```{r}
cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars)
ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, type = "lower", lab = TRUE, hc.order = TRUE, insig = "blank",lab_size = 3) + ggtitle("Correlation Matrix Plot")
```
```{r}
aggregate_mt <- aggregate(mpg ~ am + vs, data = mtcars, FUN = mean)
aggregate_mt
```
