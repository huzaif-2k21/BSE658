## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
abc <- rnorm(10, 75,10)
mean(abc)
sd(abc)

```
```{r}
bc <- rnorm(10000,75,10)
mean(bc)
sd(bc)
```
#change the degrees of freedom and curve becomes similar to normal distribution as it picks lesser from middle and more on the edges
```{r}
norm <- hist(rnorm(10000,0,1))
cd <- rt(10000,10)
t_dist <- hist(cd)
hist(cd, bins=6)
```
```{r}
plot(norm$mids,norm$density, type="l",col="blue",lwd=3)
plot(t_dist$mids,t_dist$density, type="l",col="blue",lwd=3)
```
```{r}

```
