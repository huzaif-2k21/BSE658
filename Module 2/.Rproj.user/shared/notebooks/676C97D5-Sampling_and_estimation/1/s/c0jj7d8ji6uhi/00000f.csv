"0","bargraph.CI( x.factor = year,             # grouping variable"
"0","             response = attendance,       # outcome variable"
"0","             data = afl,                  # data frame with the variables"
"0","             ci.fun= ciMean,              # name of the function to calculate CIs"
"0","             xlab = ""Year"",               # x-axis label"
"0","             ylab = ""Average Attendance"") # y-axis label "
