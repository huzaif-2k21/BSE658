## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```
inferences: i. loaded and visually checked data to see distribution based on different categories such as : age vs wages and education vs wages with categorization on basis on gender and languages 
ii. plotted box plot to visaulise central tendancies and outliers
iii. found out the central tendencies of diff coloumn data and checked its skewness along with range and spread.
iv described data on diff variables with single and more than 1 also(grouping of variables)
v drawn out various conclusions at the end
