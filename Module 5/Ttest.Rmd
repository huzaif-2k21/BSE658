Install lsr, psych library if not already installed
```{r}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) # set curretn path as workpath
install.packages('psych')
install.packages('lsr')
```

```{r}

```


```{r}
library(lsr)
load( file.path("zeppo.Rdata" )) 
oneSampleTTest( x=grades, mu=67.5 ) #add the mu value here

```


```{r}

load (file.path("harpo.Rdata" ))
str(harpo)
```

```{r}
head( harpo )
```


```{r}
independentSamplesTTest( 
      formula = grade ~ tutor,  # formula specifying outcome and group variables
      data = harpo,             # data frame that contains the variables
      var.equal = TRUE          # assume that the two groups have the same variance
  )
```
```{r}
independentSamplesTTest( 
      formula = grade ~ tutor,  # formula specifying outcome and group variables
      data = harpo              # data frame that contains the variables
  )
```


```{r}
load( file.path("chico.Rdata" ))
str(chico) 
```
 paired sampke t test is used as sample samples have been sampled and it is not independant
the difference can be taken and it can be converted to one sample test assuming population mean to be zero.(assuming null hypothesis of that there is no improvement)

```{r}
head( chico )
```


```{r}
library( psych )
describe( chico )
```



```{r}
chico$improvement <- chico$grade_test2 - chico$grade_test1 
```


```{r}
head( chico )
```
```{r}
oneSampleTTest( chico$improvement, mu=0 )
```
```{r}
wilcox.test( x = chico$improvement, mu=0)
```
