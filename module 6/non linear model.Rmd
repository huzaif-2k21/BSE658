## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lsr)
```

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

For linear mixed models, load these libraries
```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
```


```{r}
library(car)
```



```{r}
load( file.path("C:/Users/hp/Documents/GitHub/BSE658/module 6/clinicaltrial.Rdata" ))
str(clin.trial)
print( clin.trial )
```

```{r}
xtabs( ~drug, clin.trial )
```


calculate means and standard deviations

```{r Opening Data}
aggregate( mood.gain ~ drug, clin.trial, mean )
```

produce a pretty picture plots
You might want to install it by using (install.packages("gplots"))
observe the graph carefully 
```{r Opening Data}
library(gplots)
plotmeans(  formula = mood.gain ~ drug,  # plot mood.gain by drug
            data = clin.trial,           # the data frame
            xlab = "Drug Administered",  # x-axis label
            ylab = "Mood Gain",          # y-axis label
            n.label = FALSE              # don't display sample size
)
```

```{r}
interaction.plot(x.factor = clin.trial$drug, response = clin.trial$mood.gain, 
                 trace.factor = clin.trial$therapy)
```

```{r}
m0 <- lm(mood.gain ~ drug + therapy, data=clin.trial)
summary(m0)
```

```{r}
m1 <- lm(mood.gain ~ drug * therapy, data=clin.trial)
summary(m1)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
