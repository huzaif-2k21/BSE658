## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
data("airquality")  # Load the dataset
airquality <- na.omit(airquality)  # Remove rows with NA values
head(airquality)
```

```{r}
lm_simple <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = airquality)
summary(lm_simple)
```
The p value is here is very less stating that we can reject the null hypothesis of temp not affecting the ozone and slope is positive inferring a positive correlation
```{r}
lm_null <- lm(Ozone ~ 1, data = airquality)  # Start with an empty model
lm_full <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Solar.R + Wind + Month, data = airquality)  # Full model with all predictors
forward_model <- step(lm_null, scope = list(lower = lm_null, upper = lm_full), direction = "forward")
summary(forward_model)
```
the forward model selection method helped in sequentially selecting the varibales on theie AIC values . Variables like temp, wind, solar radiation had with great confidence value ( low p values <0.05 suggest it) but the the model also included month but it did have a signicifant p-value and thus not so confidence so it shows it might have a weaker effect. 

```{r}
backward_model <- step(lm_full, direction = "backward")
summary(backward_model)
```
The backward selction also showed similar result as forward model but with increase oreder for selction oF AIC score . The R-squared value is 0.6199, indicating that approximately 61.99% of the variance in Ozone levels is explained by this model. The F-statistic in both also has significant p-value showing it has strong model for prediction. 

```{r}
plot(x=lm_full, which = 2)  # QQ plot for residuals
shapiro.test(residuals(lm_full))  # Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
```
The test fails normaility
```{r}
residuals( object = lm_full )
```
```{r}
#checking for the outliers using cooks distance
cks <- cooks.distance( model = lm_full)
cks
```
```{r}
plot(lm_full,which=4)
```
```{r}
hist( x = residuals(lm_full),   # data are the residuals
       xlab = "Value of residual",      # x-axis label
       main = "",                       # no title 
       breaks = 20                      # lots of breaks
 )
```
```{r}
yhat.2 <- fitted.values( object = lm_full)
 plot( x = yhat.2, 
       y = airquality$Ozone,
       xlab = "Fitted Values",
       ylab = "Observed Values" 
 )
```
```{r}

```
